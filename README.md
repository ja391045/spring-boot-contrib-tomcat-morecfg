# spring-boot-contrib-tomcat-morecfg
Exposes many more embedded Tomcat options than standard spring boot.

The goal of this project is to enable omplete customization of Tomcat listeners via application.properties or application.yml, without the need to edit an @Configuration class.  This might be useful if the target environment of your application is varied, or unknown, and you wish to add easy customization of listening ports, SSL parameters, or socket options without requiring an configuration class to be edited and recompiled.

# This project is under construction & coming soon.
